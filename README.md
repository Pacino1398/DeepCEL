# DeepCEL
DeepCEL presents a novel feature extraction and matching framework that integrates cross-scale embeddings and a cross-attention mechanisms within an encoder-decoder structure, enabling robust and scale-aware visual localization. The method effectively enhances keypoint saliency and descriptor discriminability, especially in challenging scenarios such as low-light environments.
